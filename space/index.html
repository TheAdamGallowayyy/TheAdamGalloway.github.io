	<h1> Welcome to Space Dodge by Invision Studios</h1>
	<p> Do not adjust your screens, the website you are seeing has been served to you courtesy of the past. When you loaded this website, you unknowingly got transported through time and you have ended up in the dark ages of 1995. The following information is strictly confidential and is not to be shared without the greatest discretion.</p>

	<p>It is 2014 and you are dismayed that the predicted Mayan apocalypse has yet to have wiped out the entirety of the human race and you have fled Earth in the hopes that your repetitive premonitions have been correct. You have stolen a classified space shuttle from the NASA headquarters in Houston, Texas and are travelling at 5,000 MPH towards an unknown destination. Standing between you and your hallucinogenic dream of a far-distant Utopian society there are obstacles in your way. You are faced with inanimate and occasionally conscious obstacles which are stopping you from proceeding in your quest to a distant planet. You have flown past an active black hole created by a dying star over 20 years ago, relative to the space-time continuum, of course. But by doing this you have managed to create a wormhole which has transported you and your ship through the 4th dimension of time back 19 years to the dark ages of 1995. You have ended up in a desolate space, devoid of any space junk and unnatural satellites and your primary mission is to make your way to the 'Utopian' world that awaits you.</p>
