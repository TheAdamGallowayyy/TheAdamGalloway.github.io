	<h1>Space Dodge FAQ</h1>
	
	<h2>Why does your website look so bad?</h2>
	<p>Because it suits the theme of the game. (and I'm lazy with HTML)</p>

	<h2>What is your game about?</h2>
	<p>Didn't you read the front page? This is not simply a game.</p>
	
	<h2>Whatever happened to 'Rhino rampage'?</h2>
	<p>We felt that our original idea was not viable in our restricted timeframe.</p>
	
	<h2>Where can I find a copy of your game?</h2>
	<p>My god, can you not see the links at the bottom of every page?</p>
	
	<h2>What platforms is your game available for?</h2>
	<p>Space Dodge currently works on Android and Desktop. We are working on an iOS release.</p>

	<h2>What is your game's age rating?</h2>
	<p>Our game has been created to abide by the PEGI 7 age rating standard but we are yet to be officially rated. </p>
