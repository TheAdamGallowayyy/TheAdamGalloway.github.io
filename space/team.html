	<h1>The Invision Team</h1>
	<p>This is an overview of all 4 of our team members and their individual roles in the team and in the creative process. Our team won the original PBL presentation competition with our game 'Rhino Run', which we ended up changing due to issues with time restrictions. We have gotten rid of 3 artists from our group in order to shed some weight and allow us to work better as a team.</p>
